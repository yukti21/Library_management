# Digital Library Management System

This repository highlights the development of a robust **Digital Library Management System**, integrating database management with a user-friendly web interface. The system is designed to manage and analyze large-scale library data efficiently, leveraging multiple datasets and APIs.

---

## **Objective**

- To design a scalable and efficient database for library management using an RDMS schema in **3NF**.
- To create a seamless web interface for interacting with the database.
- To integrate and clean data from diverse sources, ensuring consistency and usability.

---

## **Key Highlights**

- **Database Schema**:
  - Designed a relational database schema in **3NF** with over 10 tables.
  - Hosted the schema on **PostgreSQL** for high-performance query execution.

- **Data Integration**:
  - Combined data from the **Goodreads dataset** on Kaggle and **OpenReads API** with a custom customer database.
  - Ensured consistency across datasets by performing extensive cleaning and validation.

- **Web Interface**:
  - Built a web interface for easy interaction with the database, enabling operations like book search, borrowing, and recommendations.

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Ran SQL queries to test the database and analyzed results to enhance efficiency.

## **Skills and Tools Demonstrated**

- **Database Design**:
  - Created a normalized database schema ensuring reduced redundancy and improved scalability.
  - Implemented efficient relationships among tables to support various queries.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Goodreads dataset.
  - Cleaned and reorganized data using Python to meet the systemâ€™s requirements.

- **Backend and Integration**:
  - Used Python for database connectivity, data cleaning, and API integration.
  - Ensured smooth data flow between the web interface and the database.

- **Technologies Used**:
  - **PostgreSQL** for database hosting and query execution.
  - **Python** for EDA, cleaning, and API integration.
  - Web technologies for designing an intuitive user interface.

## **Methodologies**

1. **Database Schema Design**:
   - Defined over 10 tables to represent entities like books, customers, loans, ratings, and reviews.
   - Ensured schema adhered to **3NF** principles to eliminate redundancy.

2. **Data Integration and Cleaning**:
   - Merged Goodreads and OpenReads API datasets with a custom customer database.
   - Addressed missing and inconsistent data using Python libraries like Pandas.
   - Reformatted and validated data for compatibility with the database schema.

3. **Web Interface Development**:
   - Designed a simple and interactive web interface to perform operations such as:
     - Book search and filtering.
     - User account management.
     - Borrow and return tracking.

4. **Query Optimization**:
   - Tested database efficiency by running complex queries for analytics and recommendations.
   - Improved performance through schema redesign and query tuning.

---

## **Applications**

- **Library Management**:
  - Streamlined cataloging, borrowing, and returning processes.
  - Provided data-driven insights into popular books and user preferences.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Enabled librarians to analyze borrowing trends and improve resource allocation.

- **Customer Experience**:
  - Delivered personalized recommendations through data integration and analysis.

---

## **Future Scope**

- Add support for real-time inventory updates and notifications.
- Integrate recommendation systems using machine learning to suggest books.
- Enhance the web interface with advanced search filters and visualization tools.
- Extend compatibility to other APIs for broader data integration.
